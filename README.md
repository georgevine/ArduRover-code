# ArduRover-code
Hello, and welcome to the GitHub repository for ArduRover, my Arduino powered autonomous rover project.
A full blog on the creation of this project can be found at http://vinethefourth.com/

This repository contains 3 discrete pieces of code:
    first_auto: the main endpoint of this project. Autonmous obstacle avoidance and wireless control over Bluetooth
    remote_control_power: test code to demonstrate basic motor control over a serial connection
    sensortest_onePing: test code to demonstrate control of ultrasonic distance sensor over a serial connection
